## TFC Data System

This project is an interactive data analysis and visualization system I built to analyze and present Bowdoin Student Government Treasury Funding Commission (TFC) allocations.

- **Source code:** https://github.com/justinz926/TFC-Data-System  
- **Live app:** https://tfc-data-system.streamlit.app/

The system ingests raw allocation and club datasets, normalizes them, and renders interactive dashboards for category-level and club-level analysis using Streamlit.
