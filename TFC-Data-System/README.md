# TFC Data System

This directory is a placeholder for the TFC Data System project.

To include the TFC Data System code in this repository without harming the original Streamlit app, you should add the TFC Data System repository as a Git submodule in this folder. This keeps the code synchronized with the original repository.

If you prefer not to use submodules, you can manually copy your existing TFC Data System files into this `TFC-Data-System/` directory.
